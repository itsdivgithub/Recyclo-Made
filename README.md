# RecycloMade

##About-
RecycloMade is a lottery game where users can participate by signing through metamask and in order to win prizes they must recycle waste items and create handmade items from them. After that, they have to mint NFT of their work by clicking pictures of their handmade item and submitting it in the form on the website. We will select the best handmade crafts and reward users with gifts and prizes. This game will spread awareness about the importance of recycling and make people recycle more and show creativity by making handmade items. Global Warming is a serious concern and the Recyclomade community understands it, we will work more to make our Dapp better and useful.
